# Hackathon

## Goals

The main goal of this hackathon is to introduce automated tests for bioinformatic tools, using GitHub Actions. 

However, there is of course more to this hackathon than only the main goal: 

1. We also want this to be an educational exercise.
2. Hackathons like these are a great way to get to know other bioinformaticians, so we also want to stimulate interaction, even if the hackathon is virtual.
3. Finally, we could get a publication out of this (ideas welcome! e.g. a PLOS Computational Biology Ten simple rules?).

## Program

**NB: This is a tentative planning and might be subject to change.**

The hackathon will be held over the course two days, currently planned for December 3rd and 4th (Thu-Fri). ASM NGS will take place from 7 to 11 December (Mon-Fri).
We adhere to the same timezone as the ASM NGS conference itself, meaning the default timezone will be Eastern Standard Time (GMT -5:00).
However, we will try to organize the schedule in such a way that takes into account timezones of all participants.

There are two possibilities how to organize the schedule:

1. We stick to the EST timezone, and make a full schedule based on this timezone. The schedule will include a plenary start and end of the day, and hopefully some virtual drinks as well.
2. We subdivide participants into teams based on timezones (e.g. the Americas, Africa & Europe, Australasia) and try to have a single plenary session each day, which more of less falls within feasible office hours for each timezone.

Both possibilities have their pros and cons. Option 1 means participants have to adapt their working hours to EST. However, this option probably offers most interaction and possibilities for interactive sessions with all participants. 
On the other hand, option 2 offers relatively normal working hours for participants, at the cost of the interaction between teams in different timezones.

## Teams

To stimulate interaction, we will subdivide participants into teams. Ideally, these teams will cover different levels of experience with Git, GitHub Actions, and software testing.
This way, every team can contribute to testing software.

*Possibly, we will also subdivide participants into teams based on their timezones.*

Participants and their teams are:

Name|GitHub profile|Team
---|---|---
Lee|[lskatz](https://github.com/lskatz)|Team 1
Boas|[boasvdp](https://github.com/boasvdp)|Team 2

## Communication

There are several communication channels that can be used during this hackathon:
1. This GitHub repository will contain all developed testing workflows and an overview of tools that have been included. For development of new testing workflows, please fork this repo and make changes in your fork (for details see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)).
2. The channel `#hackathon_2020` in the microbioinfo Slack. This will be used for plenary announcements/messaging. Let us know if you don't have access there!
3. A **(Zoom/Skype/Teams?)** link for plenary meetings.

Teams can also set up their own communications channels to work together. Please let us know if you need help setting these up or if you want organizers to join those.
